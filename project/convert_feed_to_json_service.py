    Converts an RSS or Atom feed into a structured JSON format.

    This function is supposed to utilize an external library to parse the RSS/Atom feed and convert it into JSON.
    However, since external libraries cannot be imported, the implementation details on how the feed parsing and conversion is done are omitted.

    Args:
        feed_url (str): The URL of the RSS or Atom feed that needs to be converted to JSON format.

    Returns:
        FeedConversionResponse: Outputs the converted RSS/Atom feed in a structured JSON format, mirroring the essential elements of the source feed.

    For demonstration purposes, the response is being hard-coded as this is an illustrative example.
